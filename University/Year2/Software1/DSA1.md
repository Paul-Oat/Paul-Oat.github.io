# Second Year - Data Structures and Algorithms 1


### Coursework
**Practical**
- An introduction to standard computing practices, including algorithms and data structures.
- Comparing and presenting the speed and efficiency of two algorithms, Rabin-Karp and KMP, on various human genomes.
- Code can be found here:
    - [Source.cpp](Source.cpp)
    - [utils.cpp](utils.cpp)
    - [utils.h](utils.h)
    - The genome used was found on github however has snice been taken down.
